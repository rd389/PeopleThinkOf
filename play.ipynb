So I don't really have a solution for success and I can't say that the industry *isn't* impossible to get into, but I do think the work, the actual rewarding part of it, is available to you at any time.

      "u'Answer: You know I sort of fell into an audience at a young age because I went #VIRAL so any advice I\\u2019d give on starting out building a career would be silly as I got very lucky very early. But I do think there\\u2019s a lot working against young people who are wanting to make things right now, and they are things I\\u2019ve struggled with and continue to struggle with and I don\\u2019t feel are talked about enough. Everyone talks about how great these new internet distribution models are\\u2014and they are, they\\u2019re more democratic and from the bottom and up and they allow people to be in control of how they share their work with others\\u2014but I also think they create really toxic impulses. Brand-building, self-promotion. These are fine things to do once you\\u2019ve actually worked hard enough to get good enough where you can make something worthy of being shared. But it should never be a starting point. The first step when starting out should always be to get as good as you possibly can at the thing you\\u2019re doing. Learn a ton, try different things, challenge yourself, fuck up, learn more. And I\\u2019m not saying this to say \\u201cfuck success, do the work\\u201d\\u2014I really do believe that good work *is* the best promotion\\u2014that if you want to have your thing seen by a lot of people, the best chance you have is to make it as good as possible. In getting an audience early, I realized how incredibly fluky and volatile people\\u2019s attention was. And that trying to control it directly was impossible. The only thing I ever have had control of was the actual work. And for me, the corny truth at the center of it is that you should try to follow your impulse to GIVE something to people, not the impulse to get something from them. I try to tell myself to just shut the fuck up and work hard on something that I think is good and important and make it as good as I can and when I\\u2019m done with it, share it. Self-promotion should be the last step, not the first. But also I got super lucky and didn\\u2019t have to promote myself so I\\u2019m a bit of a privileged hypocrite \\u2013 but like that self-branding shit is pretty gross and I just think like makes you feel icky and unsatisfied and I don\\u2019t think leads to happiness even when it works. But making things is fun. So make stuff! Hope that made any sense.'\n",

      "u'Question: Bo, I\\'m the same age as you and i\\'ve been watching your work since high school when you were a brand new Youtube sensation. \\n\\nEvery special you put out seems to resonate very strongly with me and where I have been mentally throughout the years, and Make Happy was no exception. \\n\\nThere\\'s a bit in the new special about you simply being an overpaid service industry professional, and I\\'ve also heard you say similar remarks in interviews. I think that is ludicrous. Your show is so much more than simply a \"comedy special\" - you blend comedy with real, raw emotions (whether staged or genuine) and speaks to people in a much stronger way than a \"typical\" comedian does.\\n\\nAs someone who has personally gone through depression, I cried at the end of your new special. I replayed that last bit literally 8-10 times that day. There\\'s not a lot of entertainers, in any industry, that can connect on such a direct, pure emotional level with people in that way.\\n\\nI hope that, whatever work you do in the future, you continue to be yourself and produce the content that you think you should produce. I don\\'t know Bo (ha) but (based on the service-industry comment) I feel like you do not give yourself enough credit for the voice you have and the real connection you have to your audience.\\n\\nDo you have any ideas or plans on where or what you want to do next?'\n",

I\\'m sorry to hear you\\'ve struggled with depression, I never have, and wouldn\\'t claim to, but I\\'ve had people in my life who have and I\\'ve dealt with separate feelings of anxiety. The truth is, about the \"service industry\" comment, is I don\\'t see that as a slam. Or a downplay. I think it\\'s a wonderful thing to be of service to other people. And entertainers should try to see themselves as in the service industry. We\\'re hear to give people something. That\\'s a good thing I think. And who knows what\\'s next! Just sort of cooling off from this. Thanks again for the thoughtful comment. Very appreciated.'\n",
